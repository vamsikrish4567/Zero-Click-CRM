The attribution reporting helped us cut spend on low-performing channels.\n\nCSM: Excellent results! What are your Q2 goals?\n\nCEO: We want to maintain this momentum and hit $5M in Q2, up from $3.8M in Q1.\n\nSales VP: We need to hire 3 more reps. Can HubSpot scale with us?\n\nCSM: Absolutely. Your current plan supports unlimited users. I recommend adding Sales Hub Enterprise for advanced forecasting.\n\nMarketing VP: We're planning a major product launch in Q2. What campaigns do you recommend?\n\nCSM: I suggest: email sequence, social ads, webinar series, and partner co-marketing. Our launch playbook has generated avg $500K for similar companies.\n\nCEO: That playbook sounds valuable. What's involved?\n\nCSM: 12-week program with templates, weekly coaching, and dedicated support. Investment is $25K but typical ROI is 10-20x.\n\nSales VP: With our growth rate, that's a no-brainer. Let's do it.\n\nCSM: Perfect! I'll get you started next week. Let's also set up monthly check-ins to track progress.\n\nMarketing VP: One more thing - can we integrate HubSpot with our new data warehouse?\n\nCSM: Yes, we have pre-built connectors for all major data warehouses.
