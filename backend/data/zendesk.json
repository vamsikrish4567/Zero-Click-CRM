Tell me about your current support setup.\n\nThomas: We're handling about 500 tickets daily across email, phone, and chat. Using an outdated ticketing system that can't keep up.\n\nAccount Executive: 500 tickets is significant volume. What are your biggest pain points?\n\nThomas: Response times. Our SLA is 4 hours, but we're averaging 6-8 hours. Customers are unhappy.\n\nAccount Executive: Let me show you how Zendesk can help. First, our AI-powered routing ensures tickets go to the right agent immediately.\n\nThomas: We've tried routing before. It doesn't always work well.\n\nAccount Executive: Ours learns from your data. After 2 weeks, accuracy is typically 95%+. Wrong department tickets drop dramatically.\n\nThomas: That would help. But what about agent productivity?\n\nAccount Executive: Multiple features here. Macros for common responses, knowledge base integration for suggested articles, and automated workflows.\n\nThomas: Macros we have. Knowledge base integration sounds interesting.\n\nAccount Executive: When an agent opens a ticket, AI suggests relevant KB articles. Agents can send them to customers or use them to craft responses. Cuts response time in half.\n\nThomas: Half? That's significant. What about live chat?\n\nAccount Executive: Integrated seamlessly. Chat conversations can escalate to tickets if needed. Agents handle email and chat from one interface.\n\nThomas: We currently have separate systems for email and chat. It's inefficient.\n\nAccount Executive: Exactly why unified inbox is so valuable. One view for all channels - email, chat, phone, social media.\n\nThomas: Social media support too?\n\nAccount Executive: Yes. Monitor Twitter, Facebook, Instagram mentions. Respond directly from Zendesk. Everything tracked and measured.\n\nThomas: That's comprehensive. What about reporting?\n\nAccount Executive: Real-time dashboards, custom reports, agent performance metrics, customer satisfaction tracking, SLA compliance monitoring.\n\nThomas: Can we see individual agent performance?\n\nAccount Executive: Absolutely. First response time, resolution time, customer satisfaction scores, ticket volume - all tracked per agent.\n\nThomas: We need that for performance reviews. What's the pricing for 25 agents?\n\nAccount Executive: Enterprise plan is $115 per agent per month for your volume. That's $2,875 monthly, billed annually.\n\nThomas: That's higher than our current system.\n\nAccount Executive: True, but consider the ROI. Faster response times mean happier customers, fewer escalations, higher retention. Most customers see 30% improvement in CSAT within 3 months.\n\nThomas: 30% CSAT improvement would justify the cost. What about implementation?\n\nAccount Executive: We provide dedicated implementation specialist, data migration assistance, team training, and 30-day support during transition.\n\nThomas: How long does implementation take?\n\nAccount Executive: For your size, 4-6 weeks. We can go live in phases - start with email tickets, add chat, then phone integration.\n\nThomas: Phased approach makes sense. Can we do a pilot with 5 agents first?\n\nAccount Executive: Great idea. Two-week pilot, same features, no commitment. I'll set it up this week.\n\nThomas: Perfect. Let's do it."

CSAT score went from 72% to 89%. Ticket resolution 40% faster.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: Those are fantastic results! What features drove those improvements?\n\nEmily: AI-powered routing was huge. Tickets go to the right specialist immediately. No more reassignments.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: And your team is using macros?\n\nEmily: Extensively. We created 50+ macros for common issues. Agents love them.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: Looking at your usage, you're on the Professional plan with 15 agents. Any plans to expand?\n\nEmily: Actually, yes. We're hiring 5 more agents next quarter. We're also interested in upgrading to Enterprise.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: Enterprise would give you advanced AI, custom reporting, and sandbox environment. Why the interest?\n\nEmily: We need more sophisticated reporting for our executive team. They want customer journey analytics.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: Perfect use case for Enterprise. You'd get custom dashboards, trend analysis, and predictive insights.\n\nEmily: What about pricing? We're currently paying $1,800 monthly for 15 agents on Professional.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: Enterprise for 20 agents would be $2,700 monthly. But let me check on a loyalty discount...\n\nEmily: We'd appreciate that. We've been happy customers.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: I can offer 15% off the first year of your renewal. That brings Enterprise to $2,295 for 20 agents.\n\nEmily: That's actually less per agent than we're paying now!\n\nCustomer Success Manager: Exactly. And you get significant feature upgrades. Plus, locked in pricing for 2 years.\n\nEmily: 2-year price lock is attractive. When can we upgrade?\n\nCustomer Success Manager: I can upgrade you next week. We'll migrate your data, update permissions, and train your team on new features.\n\nEmily: Perfect. Send me the renewal contract and let's move forward.\n\nCustomer Success Manager: Will do! I'll also schedule training for the new Enterprise features."

Ticket status updates to reflect in Salesforce deal stages\n\nCan Zendesk support this level of integration? If so, what's required?\n\nThanks,\nJason\n\n---\n\nFrom: Zendesk Technical Support\nTo: Jason Martinez\n\nJason,\n\nGreat questions! Yes, all three requirements are supported through our Salesforce integration:\n\n**1. Bi-directional Sync**\nTickets created in Zendesk automatically create Cases in Salesforce, and vice versa. Status, priority, and notes sync in real-time.\n\n**2. Contact Creation**\nWhen a ticket arrives from a new email address, we can automatically create a Contact in Salesforce with available information.\n\n**3. Deal Stage Updates**\nYou can configure triggers: when ticket status changes to \"Solved\", update related Opportunity stage in Salesforce.\n\n**Setup Requirements:**\n- Zendesk Professional or Enterprise plan (you're on Enterprise \u2713)\n- Salesforce admin credentials for authentication\n- Field mapping configuration (we'll help with this)\n- Custom trigger creation (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. I'll send you our Salesforce Integration Guide\n2. Schedule a setup call with our integration specialist\n3. Test in sandbox environment before production\n\nWhen would you like to schedule the setup call?\n\nBest,\nZendesk Technical Support\n\n---\n\nFrom: Jason Martinez\nTo: Zendesk Technical Support\n\nPerfect! This is exactly what we need.\n\nLet's schedule for Thursday afternoon.

You might be hitting query limits. Are you using custom views?\n\nGregory: Yes, we have about 50 custom views across the team.\n\nSupport Agent: That's likely the issue. Each custom view queries your full ticket database. With 800 daily tickets, that's heavy.\n\nGregory: Oh! How do we fix that?\n\nSupport Agent: Two options:\n1. Optimize views - use filters instead of searching all tickets\n2. Archive old tickets - move closed tickets older than 90 days to archive\n\nGregory: Can you help us optimize views?\n\nSupport Agent: Absolutely! I can audit your views and recommend optimizations.

How does that work?\n\nSales Support: AI analyzes ticket tone automatically. Flags negative sentiment for manager review. Helps catch at-risk customers early.\n\nNatalie: That's valuable. We've lost customers because we didn't catch escalating frustration.\n\nSales Support: Exactly what it prevents! You'll see alerts: \"Customer sentiment negative\" with suggested responses.\n\nNatalie: What about the custom dashboards?\n\nSales Support: Build any dashboard you want. Examples: Executive overview, Team performance, Customer satisfaction trends, SLA compliance.\n\nNatalie: Can we share dashboards with non-Zendesk users?\n\nSales Support: Yes! Generate shareable links for executives or export as PDF for meetings.\n\nNatalie: Perfect for board presentations. What's pricing?\n\nSales Support: You're currently on Professional at $80/agent for 12 agents = $960/month. Enterprise is $125/agent = $1,500/month.\n\nNatalie: $540 more monthly. What's the ROI?\n\nSales Support: Most customers see:\n- 25% reduction in escalations (sentiment detection catches issues early)\n- 15% improvement in agent productivity (better insights)\n- 30% higher customer retention (proactive support)\n\nNatalie: If we retain even 2 customers yearly, that pays for the upgrade.\n\nSales Support: Exactly! Plus you future-proof as you grow. Enterprise scales better.\n\nNatalie: Makes sense. Can we trial Enterprise features before committing?\n\nSales Support: Yes! 30-day Enterprise trial, full features, no credit card. Your data stays if you upgrade.\n\nNatalie: Let's start the trial. How do we begin?\n\nSales Support: I'll enable Enterprise features on your account in the next hour. You'll receive an email with feature guide and training videos.\n\nNatalie: Excellent! I'll test with my team and decide before trial ends.\n\nSales Support: Perfect! I'll check in after 2 weeks to answer questions. Sound good?\n\nNatalie: Yes, thank you!\n\nSales Support: You're welcome! Enjoy exploring Enterprise features!"

      "content": "Implementation Specialist: Derek, welcome to your Zendesk implementation kickoff! Let's discuss your goals and timeline.\n\nDerek: Thanks! We're excited but also nervous. We've used our current system for 8 years.\n\nImplementation Specialist: Change is always challenging, but we'll make it smooth. Tell me about your current setup.\n\nDerek: 40 agents across 3 teams: Technical Support, Customer Success, Billing. Each team has different workflows.\n\nImplementation Specialist: Perfect. We'll create separate views and automations for each team. How do tickets arrive?\n\nTeam Lead 1: Email primarily, some phone calls, and recently added live chat.\n\nImplementation Specialist: We'll integrate all three. Everything flows into one queue, then routes automatically by team.\n\nDerek: How does routing work?\n\nImplementation Specialist: Based on rules you define. Examples: \"billing\" keyword \u2192 Billing team. Email from VIP customer \u2192 Customer Success.\n\nTeam Lead 2: Can we route based on customer tier?\n\nImplementation Specialist: Absolutely! We'll sync customer data from your CRM. Enterprise customers can auto-route to senior agents.\n\nDerek: We use Salesforce. Does that integrate?\n\nImplementation Specialist: Yes. We'll pull customer tier, contract value, and account owner. All visible in ticket sidebar.\n\nTeam Lead 3: What about macros? We have hundreds of templates.\n\nImplementation Specialist: We can import them! Send me your template file, I'll convert to Zendesk macros.\n\nDerek: That'll save weeks of work. What's our timeline?\n\nImplementation Specialist: 6-week implementation:\n- Week 1-2: Data migration and configuration\n- Week 3: Agent training (3 sessions)\n- Week 4: Parallel running (old + new system)\n- Week 5: Full cutover\n- Week 6: Support and optimization\n\nTeam Lead 1: Parallel running is smart. Gives us time to adjust.\n\nImplementation Specialist: Exactly. You'll feel comfortable before we shut off the old system.\n\nDerek: What happens to our historical tickets?\n\nImplementation Specialist: We migrate everything. Tickets, customers, attachments, comments - full history preserved.\n\nTeam Lead 2: How long does migration take?\n\nImplementation Specialist: For your volume, about 48 hours. We do it over a weekend to avoid disruption.\n\nDerek: Smart. What about training?\n\nImplementation Specialist: Three training sessions:\n1. Agents - ticket handling, macros, workflows (2 hours)\n2. Team Leads - reporting, management, escalations (2 hours)\n3. Admins - configuration, customization, integrations (3 hours)\n\nTeam Lead 3: Will you record the trainings?\n\nImplementation Specialist: Yes! Plus we provide video library and documentation. New agents can self-train.\n\nDerek: Excellent. What do you need from us to get started?\n\nImplementation Specialist: Three things:\n1. Salesforce admin credentials for integration\n2. Export of current ticket data\n3. List of your top 20 support scenarios for macro creation\n\nTeam Lead 1: We can have that by Friday.\n\nImplementation Specialist: Perfect! I'll start configuration next week. You'll see your Zendesk instance by end of next week.\n\nDerek: This sounds manageable. We're in good hands.\n\nImplementation Specialist: You absolutely are! I'll be with you through the entire process. Any questions?\n\nTeam Lead 2: What if we run into issues during parallel running?\n\nImplementation Specialist: I'll be available via Slack channel - response within 1 hour. Plus we have daily check-in calls that week.\n\nDerek: That's reassuring. Let's do this! I'm excited now.\n\nImplementation Specialist: Great! I'll send calendar invites for all our milestones. Talk to you next week!"
